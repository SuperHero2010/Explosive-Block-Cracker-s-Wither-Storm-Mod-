- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SuperHero2010
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in "nonamecrackers2"
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently making mod
- âš¡ Relation: Cracker's Wither Storm Mod and Enderite Mod
- This mod is add for Cracker's Wither Storm Mod and Enderite Mod

- Error Items:

- Amulet:

+ Amulet can't swap

+ Amulet can't flashing

+ Because I don't know how to make

- Command Block Books and Command Block Dust:

+ No Command Block Effect Particles

+ Because I don't know how to make Effect Particles

- Nuclear TNT is repair 

- I work alone but I don't work with "nonamecrackers2"

- I using mod maker Mcreator 2023.3, 2023.4, 2023.1, 2022.2

- Recipe tutorial in images

- Recipe tutorial download: in "Release Tab"

- Everyone just follow the number of explosive blocks in my creative inventory tab (except the explosive blocks that already have recipes) and then discard them all (except the 4 hard blocks that must use diamond pickaxe and the 2 hardest blocks in minecraft that must be used formidibomb) into the TNT Smithing Table (1.19.4 V2, 1.19.2 V3, 1.18.2 V2)

- I delete TNT Smithing Table and Command Block Smithing Table

- Get explosive block? Click button in your keyboard:

+ N: Natural

+ B: Building

+ M: Mineral

+ O: No Explosion

+ K: Functional

+ P: Wood and Planks

+ G: Nether

+ I: Ender
